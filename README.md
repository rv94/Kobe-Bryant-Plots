# Kobe Bryant Plots

Notes - 

1. I used the methodology suggested by Matt Weisinger [here](https://www.quora.com/How-many-points-per-game-does-the-average-NBA-player-score) to calculate the average player's ppg. I used figures from the 2018-19 regular season and post-season to calculate averages by player. I do acknowledge that this would be slightly inflated compared to most of Kobe's career due to a faster pace.
2. Game logs were obtained season by season through basketball reference.
3. Data cleaning and analysis were done through a mix of Excel and R. Plotting was done in R using ggplot2.
